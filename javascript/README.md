### compiler and interpreter

- these are the transaltors which will convert human readable code  to machine code

- compiler - direclty convert to  machine code(which is close to machine level)
- interpreted execute code line by line without converting entire code into machine code first
- byte code faster conversion and but slower while run
- js is interpreter based language
- java is compiler based
- jit compiler - its uses faster conversion of  byte code and faster run of machine code 

### window
- there are many features which are frequently used but they are not part of JS, because they are the part of JS the language but they are available in the browser and when we use them , they are called or used from the browser and Not the JS
